   <p>MAX remains vigilant all the time. It barks at the sound of any hustle near the home especially at night. It has a strong smelling sense and grows suspicious if it experiences any strange or unfamiliar smell.Max are extremely faithful and want nothing but the best for us as family. It is very protective about our family and thus guards our house at all times.</p>
